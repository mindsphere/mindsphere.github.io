## What is it

Close interaction of development and operations is essential to accelerate
delivery of applications. This is a demo across the whole DevOps cycle with
MindSphere, by using well known and widely used open source tools.

The demo consists of:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
- a simple todo app using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack
    - [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Angular App](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/) (root folder)
    - [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Backend](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/server)
        - the backend provides swagger-ui for navigating both the server apis and the MindSphere APIs (under `/api-docs`)
- local Angular dev server setup that proxies requests to MindSphere, allowing local development
- a devops admin backend that provides access to prometheus and grafana
    - [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> devopsadmin app](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/devops/devopsadmin)
    - [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Prometheus on CloudFoundry](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/devops/prometheus)
    - [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> Grafana on CloudFoundry](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/devops/grafana)
    - a [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> sample agent](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/agent) that can be used to simulate an actual device sending
  IoT data to the MindSphere APIs

Additionally, [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> tooling to ease ssh connectivity to running cf applications](https://github.com/mindsphere/devops-demo/tree/master/tools/README.md)
is provided.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Known Issues / Limitations
- The gitlab-ci integration requires manually setting authentication with access and refresh tokens available as protected CI/CD Gitlab Variables, and they need to be renewed every 30 days. This can be copied directly from your CloudFoundry CLI ~/.cf/config.json file after successful cf login.
  Storage for Prometheus is currently transient, pending support for some kind of dynamic persistent storage for apps, or direct support for Prometheus in MindSphere.
- Prometheus metrics http endpoints are read-only but not protected.
