## Guidelines

### Workflow

We use the [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
and review all changes we merge to master.

### Automated builds, tests, security and code quality checks

The code is required to pass the automated build, all unit-tests must be green and the configured security- (snyk) and code quality (lgtm) checks
must be OK before the pull request can be merged.

### Commit Message

Commit messages shall follow the conventions defined by [conventional-changelog](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
