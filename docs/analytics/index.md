# MindSphere Analytics Examples

## Jupyter Notebooks

These are the jupyter notebooks which demonstrate the use of the MindSphere Analytics APIs.

### Trend Prediction API

The Trend Prediction API predicts future values for time series using linear and nonlinear regression models. It is a forecasting framework, that has many useful applications in the area of Process & Condition Monitoring.

### KPI Calculation API

The KPI Calculation API computes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for an asset. It uses data sources such as sensors, control units and calendars.

### Spectrum Analysis API

Spectrum Analysis API allows users to perform time domain and frequency domain analysis. It provides functions to transform a time-domain signal into its frequency components (via Discrete Fourier Transform) and to detect threshold breaches of their amplitudes.
