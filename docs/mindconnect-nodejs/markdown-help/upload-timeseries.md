  Make sure that the timestamp is in ISO format. The headers and the casing (timestamp, dataPointId) are important.
  The values must correspond with data types configured in mindsphere (in example: DP-Humidity must be an integer)

  Important:

    You have to configure the data source and data mappings in mindsphere asset manager before you can upload the data
